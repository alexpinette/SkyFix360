# SkyFix360

## Brief introduction

The code is a Python script that creates a GUI (Graphical User Interface) using the PySimpleGUI library. The GUI is for correcting the horizon line in 360-degree images and videos. The GUI has two rows, the first row has an image preview area, and the second row has the options for selecting the folder containing the images or videos, a list of files in the folder, a 'Correct' button for starting the correction process, an 'Export' button for exporting the corrected image or video, a 'Help' button for displaying the help window, and a 'Quit' button for quitting the program.

The code defines several functions for creating different windows, such as the main window, the help window, the correction method selection window, and the success window. The 'runEvents' function is the main loop that handles events in the GUI, such as button clicks, and updates the GUI based on the events.

The script also imports several libraries, such as PySimpleGUI, matplotlib, numpy, PIL, cv2, and sqlalchemy. These libraries are used for various tasks such as creating the GUI, displaying and manipulating images, and working with databases.
