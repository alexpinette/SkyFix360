After Informal Meeting:
- [] Give user the choice to choose/create directory where the corrected image could be exported
- [] Button to show details of tasks in progress? Drop down of text showing current stage of program?
- [] Devise a way for user to "slightly" correct an image 
- [] Show cooordinates for points when selected
- [] (Coinsides with above ^^) Bring back toolbar/Experiment with hading parts of the toolbar
- [] Change "SuccessWindow" to be a pop up under fold row instead? Make text visible rather than window?
- [] Change "SuccessWindow" to be a message where the progress bar was so users see that immediately when correction finishes.


* Ultimate Goal is to make automatio "perfect" and support video files.
